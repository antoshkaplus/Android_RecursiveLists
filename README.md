# Android_RecursiveLists
Sometimes I just need to write somewhere some kind of list.
Those lists sometimes grouped by category. And also we want to support subcategories. 
So recursive lists are very good for those things.

TODO
- [x] don't allow user to use empty string as item name
- [x] increase right-left text edit padding in dialog box
- [ ] keep user history (about removals only ??) (only last removal)
- [ ] refactoring
- [ ] remove selected items
