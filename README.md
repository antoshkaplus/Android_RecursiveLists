# Android_RecursiveLists

## Story
Sometimes I just need to write somewhere some kind of list.
Those lists sometimes grouped by category. And also we want to support subcategories. 
So recursive lists are very good for those things.

## Features
* reposition 
* deletion 
* renaming
* adding new
* recursion on items
* undo delete operations
* keep data on the server
* moving items in and out


## Usage
* long press on list item or free space on activity and follow options
* in action bar options find action to undo removal operations

## Bugs
* Everything fixed

## TODO 
- [ ] remove selected items (maybe still do it separately)
- [ ] refactoring
- [ ] data synchronization (number one priority)
- [ ] add food to reduce copy pasting of files (don't know what should be inside food)
- [ ] add string and edit dialogs should be merged somehow in one 
        class and placed somewhere in the library
- [ ] choose login setting
