# Android_RecursiveLists
Sometimes I just need to write somewhere some kind of list.
Those lists sometimes grouped by category. And also we want to support subcategories. 
So recursive lists are very good for those things.

TODO
- [ ] refactoring
- [-] remove selected items
- [ ] send logs to server. printErrorTrace to file probably and sometimes on console???
- [ ] test data
- [ ] backup ???
- [ ] to be able to add item to the end of the list even if list is full
