# Android_RecursiveLists

## Story
Sometimes I just need to write somewhere some kind of list.
Those lists sometimes grouped by category. And also we want to support subcategories. 
So recursive lists are very good for those things.

## Features
* reposition 
* deletion 
* renaming
* adding new
* recursion on items
* undo delete operations

## Usage
* long press on list item or free space on activity and follow options
* in action bar options find action to undo removal operations

## Bugs
* after long clicking position, selection stays after user didn't pick anything in context menu.

## TODO 
- [ ] remove selected items
- [ ] refactoring
- [ ] keep data somewhere on the server
- [ ] add food to reduce copy pasting of files
- [ ] add string and edit dialogs should be merged somehow in one 
        class and placed somewhere in the library
