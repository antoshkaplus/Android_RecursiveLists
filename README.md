# Android_RecursiveLists

## Story
Sometimes I just need to write somewhere some kind of list.
Those lists sometimes grouped by category. And also we want to support subcategories. 
So recursive lists are very good for those things.

## Features
* reposition 
* deletion 
* renaming
* adding new
* recursion on items
* undo delete operations
* keep data on the server
* sync between multiple devices
* moving items in and out


## Usage
* long press on list item or free space on activity and follow options
* in action bar options find action to undo removal operations

## Bugs
* Everything fixed

## TODO
- [ ] debug everything
- [ ] work on authorization in repository
